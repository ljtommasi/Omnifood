A food delivery website built using HTML/CSS and JS. I built this website as part of [Jonas Schmedtmann's](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/?couponCode=ST13MT40224) Udemy course.<br>

  Learned about different layout techniques including Floats, Flexbox, and Grid.

  Implemented reusable components and layout patterns for efficient web development.
